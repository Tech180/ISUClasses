// File Format:
// 
// The text file can contain whitespace characters, comments (C-style),
// and binary ($readmemb) or hexadecimal ($readmemh) data values.  Both
// types of data values can contain x or X, z or Z, and the underscore
// character.
// 
// The data values are assigned to memory words from left to right,
// beginning at start_addr or the left array bound (the default).  The
// next address to load may be specified in the file itself using @hhhhhh, 
// where h is a hexadecimal character.  Spaces between the @ and the address 
// character are not allowed.  It shall be an error if there are too many 
// words in the file or if an address is outside the bounds of the array.
// 
FFFFFFFF // Loads at address 0

0000000A // Loads at address 9

@15      // Specifies the following values will be loaded starting at address 0x15 (remember, this is a .hex file so the values are in hex) or 21 in decimal
0000a000 // Loads at address 0x15
0000b000 // Loads at address 0x16
