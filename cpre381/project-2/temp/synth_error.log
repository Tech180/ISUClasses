Info (125068): Revision "toolflow" was previously opened in Quartus II software version 18.0.0 Standard Edition. Created Quartus Prime Default Settings File /home/longz/Desktop/Cpre381/project-2/internal/QuartusWork/toolflow_assignment_defaults.qdf, which contains the default assignment setting information from Quartus II software version 18.0.0 Standard Edition.
Info (125069): Default assignment values were changed in the current version of the Quartus Prime software -- changes to default assignments values are contained in file /usr/local/usr/local/quartus/20.1/quartus/linux64/assignment_defaults.qdf
Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Info (20030): Parallel compilation is enabled and will use 4 of the 4 processors detected
